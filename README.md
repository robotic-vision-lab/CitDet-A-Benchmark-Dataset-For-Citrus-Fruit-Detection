## CitDet: A Benchmark Dataset for Citrus Fruit Detection

### Overview

Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit
detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated
direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of
interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of
work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by Huanglongbing
(HLB).

This repository provides source code for our paper titled "[CitDet: A Benchmark
Dataset for Citrus Fruit Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05645.pdf)." The
CitDet dataset contains high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an
area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box
annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled
to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements
in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. In
addition, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in
typical orchard settings and provide new benchmark results. 

More information on the project can be found on the [CitDet
website](https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/citdet).

### Installation

First, begin by cloning the project:

    $ git clone https://github.com/robotic-vision-lab/CitDet-A-Benchmark-Dataset-For-Citrus-Fruit-Detection.git
    $ cd CitDet-A-Benchmark-Dataset-For-Citrus-Fruit-Detection

Then, set up a Python 3 environment and install Pytorch (1.0.1 or higher) and
TorchVision. Finally, install the remaining packages:

    $ pip install Pillow opencv-python scikit-learn numpy
	
### Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the 
[Texas Data Repository](https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18738/T8/QFVHQ5)
or the [USDA Ag Data Commons](https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1529611).
The dataset contains images in JPG format, bounding box annotations in COCO
JSON format, and pseudo labels in PNG format for semantic segmentation
generated by the Segment Anything Model.  

### Data Loader

The script ```datasets/coco.py``` contains a COCO dataset class that allows for
loading images and masks on the fly, and extracting bounding boxes and
segmentation masks. Modify this class accordingly if you need additional inputs
to your network.

### Training, Evaluation, and Visualization

To train a network on CitDet, first
[download](https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18738/T8/QFVHQ5)
the dataset. The notebook ```train_eval_visualize.py``` includes example code
for training, evaluating, and visualizing the predictions of a detection model.
Additionally, we provide an evaluation script, ```eval_coco_json.py```. 

The following command can be used to run the evaluation script:

	$ python eval_coco_json.py --pred_file path/to/preds.json --gt_file path/to/ground_truth.json
